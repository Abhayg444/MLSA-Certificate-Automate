# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Certificate Automation

This repo simply use a template certificate docx file and generates certificates
both docx and pdf.

In, `main_certificate.py' folder. Change your participants and your name with path and name.
In case, you have to deal with your own participate file due to your needs, you should update` list_participants` data.

Also, functions are very simple. You can implement your version as well freely.
